Before we came here he had one margarita at Azteca across the street. This was really  prejudice because he is not drunk and I ordered a drink and wasn't even ID'ed and I'm only 21. We will never be coming here again. The bartender is rude and there is a reason this place has shitty reviews.\n",

After having been pushed to order multiple beers (not that I minded this part that much) my server then told me to leave my card on the table and he would just get it (without being given my check). I decided to see what would happen so I did. He brought me back my receipt without my check. I then asks for my itemized check and he acted like he didn't know what I was talking about. I explained what it was to him then he brought it. Guess what!! It was lower than what he ran my card for?! Seriously!! Don't go there! They let their servers TRY to rip you off!!!\n",

The table was a bit dirty with trash around the floor but we still sat down. We started with the spinach dip, which was pretty good. However, my kids order the chicken tenders and they were greasy and the chicken was tough....ugh! My husband and I ordered the Philly cheesesteak and the smokehouse burger. Those meals were delicious! We will go back on a drunken night but we won't be regulars!!!!!\n",

            "We go as a team to this place every Thursday night after softball usually have great service. Last night was totally a cluster. Waitress was very nice and apologetic, I watched the one bartender work as hard as possible to keep up. We had 2 drinks in 2 hours waited on food for an hour (24 Wings). I approached the manager asked if he could give the bartender some help he said \" the kitchen is behind and that is where he was needed\". I then watched him approach bar pull tickets and rudely slam them in front of bartender and say \"Do these\". We also observed him sit and talk to his parents sitting at corner of the bar for 45 minutes (which they had prompt service) and neglect the atmosphere within the place. We usually leave seeing a full restaurant but we all noticed it was slow upon our exit. Policy: care for your staff, your customers and visit your parents on your time off. Lost our teams visit every week.\n",
            "Regretfully one of the worst meals I've had to date. Our experience started off on a bad note, from which it never recovered, when the waitress brought us our first round of cocktails.... Two in our party ordered Moscow Mule's, but were served watered down ginger beer/vodka blends sans copper mug,  mint, and ice. The waitress seemed annoyed and let us know that, \"if we ordered another one after this, we can have it in a copper cup\". \n",
            "My question is, if the drink sat long enough for all of the ice to melt; what would another 90 seconds to wash the mugs be? The waitress was unapologetic, but did note that we could order something else. I opted for a beer, which came out without issue (in a bottle). \n",
            "My next major problem was with my entree. I ordered shrimp and grits, a southern classic, which I have ordered more than a half dozen times at this restaurant in the past. The shrimp came out without being deveined. This is 100% unacceptable at even the most mediocre of greasy-spoon type establishments, much less at a $16 price point at Hickory Tavern. Again, the waitress seemed barely bothered by the snafu, and we did not receive an apology or explanation by management. A gentleman came out after the meal was sent back, asking for an explanation. I showed him the picture and explained the shrimp was not deveined, which seemed to baffle him. I'm not sure if he was in disbelief or was not sure what I meant by \"the shrimp was not deveined\". Either way, he did not respond to my negative experience in any way other than making a face and walking away... \n",

            "I called a little after lunch and talked to the manager.  I asked if they would have sound for the game 7 of the NHL.  He said, yes, no problem, as long as someone else hasn't asked for sound of another game first.  So, I tell my buddies to come along.\n",
            "\n",
            "With that in mind, we get there early.  I ask about sound and the server said, sure, we've just got music playing, shouldn't be a problem.  She takes our first beer order and goes back to talk to the manager.  She comes back with our beers and being a polite person, and the game hadn't started yet, I didn't ask about the sound.  We wait and wait, still no sound in the game.  Our server comes by one more time and we order another round, she said she'd check on the sound.  We get our beers, and never see the server again.  Nor the manager.\n",
            "\n",
            "I eventually just left cash on the table, no check ever came, no sound, absolutely ridiculous and just plain out rude.  The manager could have at least come by with a BS excuse and pretended we existed.  I could have just as easily watched the game at my house, but friends wanted to go out.  We won't ever be back.\n",
            "I was led to believe I had a reservation for a corporate seminar event booked in their private room.  I called and they told me they had me down.  Then I went in the first time and they assured me it was reserved, we would do a contract as we got closer.  I found this odd, but we had booked the same event the year before and there had been no problem.  Yesterday, I called with some planning questions.  They told me they weren't holding the room and if I wanted it, I had better get in and do a contract ASAP.  So today, in went in to do a contract.  The GM, Tom Blake informed me that they had a weekly group that used the room every week on that day and I needed to find another place.  I am very frustrated as I had already sent invitations with their location on it.  But, I understand people make mistakes sometimes.  The reason it is one star, is because Tom was an unbelievable jerk.  He could not care less or deliver any sort of an apology on the matter.  This man has a nasty attitude problem and lacks the basic people skills that should be required of his job.   I have already rebooked my event at another similar restaurant close by.  But I will not soon forget my horrible experience with this GM and I will never dine at Hickory Tavern again.\n",
            "We say for 10 mins while our server was flirting with other servers. Never got to order food. They even just watched us walk out. No one even tried to stop us. Won't be back\n",
            "Yesterday was mother's day and my family and I made a reservation earlier in the week to eat here. They had the table ready for us when we arrived and we sat down immediately. Our waiter was extremely nice and patient with everyone. We got our drinks and food in a very timely manner and everything was delicious. No one had any problems with their food, except one and the waiter fixed it before she could even tell him what was wrong. My drink from the bar was excellent. Great lunch for all 13 of us!\n",
            "I planned a get-together event at the Hickory Tavern Northlake for our wedding weekend on April 27, 2013. I initially wanted to have the event at the nearby Fox and the Hound, which I was very comfortable with, but the Hickory Tavern was more conveniently located next to the Hilton Garden Inn Northlake where our guests were staying.\n",
            " \n",
            "To ease things on the restaurant, I called the Hickory Tavern Northlake about a week before and let them know I would have a big group of at least 25 people arriving shortly after 9:30PM on Friday, April 26.\n",
            "\n",
            "About eight people from the group arrived at 9:30PM, but the majority of the group and I were a little late because our rehearsal dinner ran longer than expected. I got there around 11:00PM and the majority of the guests got there at 11:15PM. \n",
            "When I arrived, I was happy to see a big space near the bar with tables that our large group of 35+ people could enjoy. As I was greeting everyone and saying hello, I thought things were great. However, I quickly became frustrated as soon as I wanted a beer and could not get any service. I waited for our server for several minutes.  I tried to go the bar to order a drink, but because I had said hello to my group of friends already at the tables, the bartender said I was not allowed to open a tab unless I was going to sit at the bar. I never got a reason on why this was the case, but it was very frustrating. I finally got my beer from the server after several more minutes. My fiancée arrived a few minutes later and we had to go through the same ordeal. \n",
            " \n",
            "As the rest of the group arrived on the bus, the problem became extremely obvious since no one was able to get a drink. Everyone tried the same thing I did in going to the bar and each was turned away as soon as they said they were with my group. Seeing their frustration, I went to the bar to figure out a solution. They were not willing to work with me. I ended up having to express to the bar tenders that our group of 35+ people was going to have to leave and get service somewhere else if the situation did not improve. We kept talking with no progress, but eventually a manager came over. The manager assigned us several more waiters, which eased the frustration in our group. The waiters did a great job and provided adequate service, but it would have been a lot easier if the bar would have allowed service there. \n",
            "\n",
            "As a result of my experience, I would not recommend Hickory Tavern for large happy hour or drinking type events unless everyone is planning to be seated at the bar or at one table. Unfortunately the bar only seats about 15-20 people. In general, you should not expect their bar environment to behave like a typical bar, even in the 11PM - 2AM time period (the hours that we were there). We had a perfect wedding weekend and this was really the only stress or disappointment I can recall. \n",

Remind you it is a slow night and the bartender has not approached us or greeted us yet. He walked passed us at 3 times and served someone else that walked in after us. Never seen such a lazy ass bar tender who the hell wants to sit at a unclear bar. We just left. Nothing like he other Hickory Taverns.\n",
            "They had a pretty good selection of tap beers which is an automatic 4 stars.  The fact that they have pool and a plethora of TV's made it even better.  I'd visit again if ever in the area.\n",
            "This place is such a waste of money. Think Applebee's atmosphere, with food that has no flavor whatsoever. I mean none. It's like they went out of their way to make everything as bland as possible. I got the shrimp tacos.. with no flavor. My girlfriend got the chicken sandwich.. that tasted like it was made before seasoning was invented. You've been warned: over priced, under spiced, and the most forgettable meal of my life.\n",
            "Nice sports bar and great wait staff.  Food is very good.  The steak sandwich is a great cut of meat.  The grilled wings are also fantastic.  I especially like the fact they have free Wi-Fi.  \n",
            "\n",
            "What is disheartening is the smoke.  Like most of NC eating establishments the bar area is filled with smokers.  The air handles do a decent job, but your clothes still smell in the suitcase when you get home.  Also, the liquor is a bit pricey so if you can bribe the bartender you get a better deal.  \n",

Now our server Jade, seemed like she didn't really want to be here to work, which i completely understand. But we watched 2 tables walk out on her shift. There were no, sorry I'm running behind, etc etc. just completely ignored them and just shrugged her shoulders after they both went to the hostess to complain. Being in the customer service industry, I know we work for our tips. I guess she could care less.\n",
            "I was there on a Friday night a couple weeks ago and ordered the fresh tuna appetizer. ..my guest order the same with  a side of broccoli and his portion was smaller... my tuna was extremely and I asked if that was the norm ... the waitress immediately asked if I wanted to have them prepared again after we noticed my guest portion was not as salty... it was prepared again and came back okay!  I wasn't overly impressed and although I just recently moved to the area... I won't be in a hurry to return.  I remember frequenting the restaurant about 10 years ago at the same location ...but recall it being more inviting of an atmosphere and the food being superior... it feels like a different place now. ..What happened?\n",

The service would have received the Gold Star, except the server forgot to bring the tea we ordered.  \n",

            "We went to this place because it was near our hotel, and the hotel actually gave us a coupon for 10% off.  I'm glad we took them up on their offer.  They had a Garden Burger that was as good as the one at Red Robin, and I believe that is the best I've ever eaten.  It did not, however, come with the bottomless fries offered at Red Robin.  The fries on this one looked bad, but actually were pretty good.  They were good enough for us to order more.  The meal was excellent, really hit the spot, and, except for that one noted glitch, the service was great.  \n",
            "\n",
            "I also enjoyed an alcoholic beverage since there were no liquor stores in the area.  I had a \"Tennessee Lemonade,\" or something like that, with whiskey in a lemonade type drink.  I loved it.  I had two, even though they were kind of pricey for my budget.  \n",
            "\n",

When I ate there the first time it seems like the waitresses always disappear and never come back. My husband ordered a beer and he never got it. I ordered cheese on fries once they forgot the cheese and when I told them they gave me cold shredded cheese. \n",
            " Tonight my husband and I ordered takeout 30 minutes before getting there I called in the order when my husband got there it wasn't ready and he had to wait an additional 30 minutes....then they made the order for dine in instead of take out. The waitresses disappeared on him a few times. Then the food...gross...nothing had flavor not even my poor piece of salmon...it was juicy but no flavor. My husband ordered wings and he said it just tasted like chicken. \n",

            "I have gone to two different Hickory Taverns within the last 3 weeks.  Not much different.  Big screens, TVs...a bar, and a decent menu.  The atmosphere was quiet during the day visit for lunch.  The night trip was also quiet...not too busy.  Service was typical for a bar restaurant.  The servers have to wait multiple tables....so not much interaction.   The food, especially the sweet potato fries, that were drizzled with honey and butter was good.  I ordered a salad with chicken.  I was surprised that the grilled chicken came out on the salad very cold....as if it was removed from freezer.  However the server was very quick to get a fresh salad topped with a very nicely grilled, chicken breast.  very good.  The other thing that provided the \"bar\" feel at one of the restaurants....was ordering bottled drinks (beers and coolers) and not being offerred a frosted mug or glass.  I thought that was fairly standard.  Should not have to ask...should have been offered.  I will return....with family and friends to see how larger crowds are handled.  good locations and good parking.\n",

(We stated lemon with the water, so it wasn't like an un-spoken request) whatever, we decided it wasn't worth a fight and went to ordering our dinner. I had a Tavern Burger, he had a Reuben. I also ordered a side salad to eat prior to my burger coming out. Once we placed our order, we did not see our waitress ONCE until after the food came out. I had been almost empty on my beverage for awhile at that point, and luckily with the food she ran and got me a refill. My salad didn't come out prior instead it came with, and was TERRIBLE. The croutons were stale, and the salad was soggy (like it had sat out in the dressing for way to long). My burger was fine, I feel as though it was small for $10, but whatever. My fries were cold. The Reuben made my boyfriend sick but he said the flavor was good, his fries also cold. \n",

            "We never saw our server again, until she dropped off the bill. So instead of complaining we paid and left and I don't plan on returning to this location. I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone, and don't see how people are raving about it.\n",
            "Ordered food from here the first time through Postmates and the artichoke dip was amazinggggg and so was the other food i ended up going again the other day with a coworker and dined in and had the fried Calamari it was to die for first time trying it and loved it the blackened fish sandwich on the other hand was mediocre but overall good experience\n",
            "The hubby and I went here to meet a large group.  They were easily able to accomodate our group at a super long pub table.  The inside of the restaurant seemed huge and the atmosphere was nice for a sports bar.  They have a pretty decent menu.  I ended up getting the smothered chicken with sweet potato fries.  My food was really good.  The sweet potato fries are pretty amazing because they drizzle some kind of sweet honey butter sauce on top.  The service was just ok, nothing outstanding.  Sadly the one thing that stands out to me for this restaurant was the sea salt hand moisturizer in the bathroom.  This stuff was amazing and left my hands nice and smooth after visiting the restroom.  They actually sell jars of the moisturizer at the hostess station but I couldn't justify spending $25 dollars for it.  I'll definitely be back to this restaurant to give it another try.\n",
            "Nothing to write home about really. The place is clean well staffed and the food is average. Nothing to really make you want to come back. This is also a chain with several restaurants in the area. Seems like the are more concerned with a restarunt on every corner than a memorable dining experience.\n",
            "How come the rating is so low??? How can you not love this bar???!!! They always have a great beer selection and awesome monthly drink specials.  The new food truck menu is amazing (reminds me of home) and the shrimp and grits are to die for. Seriously! If I was on death row hickory tavern shrimp and grits would be my last meal.\n",
            "Having never been to a Hickory Tavern before but having been to Hickory, NC let's just say I didn't have big expectations. Yes I know they're not related but that's what happens when you name yourself after what I would refer to as an oasis of parking space. Seriously have you been to Hickory before? Tiny stores with gigantic parking lots for such a small town! If they ever have a population boom and everyone moves there, they'll be ready! Anyways back on topic to the actual tavern.\n",

            "It's a sporty place, TVs everywhere, sports stuff and other things. The food was average bar food. I went on a Wednesday night which turned out to be music trivia night and 50 cent wings night. Alright lets go for the wings then! The hard part is actually getting the waitress's attention to get the wings. Seriously I thought I'd have to tackle her down to put in an order, but I'd probably tackle the wrong one. They all looked similar to me and I asked around the table and no one could remember what our waitress looked like either. After a good while we finally got our orders placed in and wings in front of us. I was just disappointed with my wings. So sad I had ordered a medium spice level on my wings which apparently translates to nonexistent and the sweet Asian glaze that I had selected really needed some heat to balance it out. A quick dunk into the blue cheese dip was a handy solution.\n",
            "\n",

            "Last night myself and two others went in for dinner. We asked for a beer menu (last time there was a laminated list) we were handed a hand written list, much shorter than the list last time. This is a sports bar and should definitely have a better beer list than a hand written list. Then it came time to order our food; I ordered boneless WINGS, one other a burger and the other a salad. When the food came, the burger was wrong and it had shredded cheese instead of sliced cheese (starting to get a cutting costs unnecessarily feeling). My BONELESS WINGS were in fact chicken TENDERS. There is a difference here. The meat tastes different in these two cuts of chicken. The food runners were very rude about my dissatisfaction. Simply said, \"that's how they come\". Well, the menu shouldn't say BONELESS WINGS then. I tried the tenders, but it just wasn't good so I sent it back and got a burger. The server was rude about me sending it back and a manager never came to check on our table. A table sent food back and a manager just didn't care. \n",
            "\n",
            "Also, the live music was horrible and entirely too loud. We had to yell at each other to talk. The hosts didn't want to actually sit us, pushed us to the bar seating which is first come first serve. When we came back and said it was full they also seemed annoyed they actually had to do some work. Overall, it's been a long time since I was this disappointed in an experience at a restaurant. \n",

The waitress was really attentive and she had a ton of customers so she did really well. I would definitely head back.\n",
            "The female bartender is extremely rude.  The customer next to me waited 10 minutes to even be greeted, and them he said \"ma'am\", and she turned her back to him and put her hand up.  I haven't even tried the food, but there is no excuse for poor customer service.\n",

            "I ended up at Hickory Tavern for my cousin's birthday dinner. I expected bar food and big TVs, and that's essentially what we got. I was a little thrown off when my GPS led me past Northlake Mall to Harris Corner, because I initially thought the restaurant was in the shopping center adjacent to the mall, but that's Fox and Hound. Not Hickory Tavern. Anyway, my experience at HT was super underwhelming. Our waitress really tried her best, but it wasn't enough to overcome the rest of the experience. First, the drinks from the bar seemed watered down. I'm not one to expect a double pour when ordering a single, but I also don't expect to order a gin and tonic with hardly any gin. Nobody at the table was pleased with their drink, except for folks who ordered beer and wine. Next, the food. I ordered the wing entree, with tater tots. The tots were room temperature and bland. The wings were ok, but by this point I was a little over the whole thing. There are too many good restaurants in Charlotte to eat mediocre food. I wouldn't go back, but if you decide to go, stick to beer/wine and don't settle for cold tater tots lol.\n",

            "\n",
            "Apparently a Honey BBQ burger is a regular burger, with a side of honey mustard and a side of bbq sauce. Looking at them, I was skeptical to mix them on my burger, so after experimenting on my plate I did discover that no, sweet and spicy honey mustard and smoky bbq sauce do not create a favorable taste once mixed together. En short, I could have just gotten a regular burger.\n",

Maybe I expect more from tacos and wings.  The service was a 3 friendly for the first part and downright rude for the ending.  My party was treated very badly when we had a simple opinion.  I travel all over the country and have eaten in every state except Alaska and I will never set foot in this place again.\n",

We got there and walked to the bar nobody greeted us, the workers were all too busy in their own conversations. We sat down at the bar and the girl there started greeted us but wasn't friendly. She was honestly horrible I was upset they share tips at the bar because I honestly just wanted to tip the other guy that was working the bar. An African American fellow. He was great. She took our order after making us wait. The food was brought out in a timely manner. After that she never checked back in on us. The guy pretty much took over and we asked him for everything else. Meanwhile, the other employees were all just gathered all around us having their own conversations pretty loud. I just didn't think that was too appropriate it was just not the best place I've been to. I think they should have taken their convos to the back or just some place else not around the guests. The food was great but I probably will not return to eat there again.\n",

We ended up going back last night and had Amanda as our server and she is so amazing! We will deff keep coming back and we will be asking to sit with her. We were going to tell the manager about how great she was but I didn't see her when we were leaving so I hope she reads this. Thanks for being a great server Amanda\n",

My selection was the Seafood Bayou with tilapia and shrimp both grilled to perfection.  The steaming hot entree was served over Tavern Rice with a side of fresh fruit that was absolutely delicious.  Being in a Tavern, I had to order something to drink.  I opted for the hard apple cider which tasted pretty much like an apple martini with a bit less punch.  It was quite tasty and I had to remind myself to sip rather than drink!  For dessert, the chocolate cake sounded delicious but I could not stuff any more into my mouth.

Secondly, my food was not cooked properly and I \"thought\" the waitress was bringing  back a whole new entree.  Nope..she returned my same \"picked over\" burger back to me fully cooked. ( Major food violation) Finally you would think the store manager  ( Tom Blake)  would be trained to handle any/all store issues right? Sad to say.. Tom's way of dealing with a overcrowded restaurant is to call the police and LIE by saying... folks are  causing trouble  and refusing to leave the restaurant. ( Not true!) I sat at my table and watched the whole incident. Those guys was not causing trouble nor refusing to leave! Anyways, I can go on and on about how awful this location treats customers! Honestly, I almost thought the staff was drunk that night! Because I have NEVER seen this type of behavior/crazyness from a restaurant.\n",

            "The salad I got wasn't bad. Just super small. I think it was the fiesta salad. It came in a small bowl. Thought its be bigger. The chicken that came with it was about 3 fingers big. And well say it was Girly fingers. Haha very small pieces. Thought there would be more chicken. Panera Bread has the same salad for way cheaper and the portion is way bigger. When it comes to dinner time, they shouldn't serve lunch sized portions to hungry ppl.\n",
            "Hickory Tavern is a local chain with several locations in the area. All the locations have many TVs and a full bar. The food is very good. Their wings are top-notch and they have a grilled version where they are finished on the grill. Two complaints I have though is that they don't have an habenero or extra hot sauce. They also don't give you very many celery sticks with the wings. With that said they have a diverse menu and their food is really good for a sports bar. If you're in the mood for seafood they have \"bucket of boat trash\" and steamed oysters. They also have fish and fish tacos. On Thursdays the oysters are on special for one dollar each and it's also three dollar draft beer night. That's why Thursday is my go to Hickory Tavern day!\n",

            "I ate here twice with a group and loved the salad as you choose what you want on it and it it's cut the way you want so you don't end up with lettuce hanging out of your mouth and I added salmon of course. The atmosphere was casual too me like a noisy dorm group room with all the tv's going. Little pricy for every day but worth the money. It is one place for me to consider for Super Bowl Sunday.\n",

            "Me and couple of friends went to this restaurant  to watch the Panthers vs Seahawks football game.  The restaurant was packed with 85% to 90% African Americans.  The restaurant had a waiting list and we was waiting for a table to come available.  As we was waiting to be seated,  an unknown white couple came to me and my colleague and advised that they vacated a table in the bar area and we can have it.  Our stay at that table was short live, we were advised by a RUDE BLONDE waitress, advised that the table reserved a white couple  and we needed to get up now. We got up and we started talking to some of our friends at a nearby table. The general manager approach me and my friends and advised us stop \"hovering over the white customer's table and we needed to go back up front now or he was going to call the police.  The general manager didn't want hear that we was talking to our friends at a nearby table and not \"hovering over\" the the white couple's table.\n",

            "The general manager over reacted to a couple law a biding customers that was trying to watch the Panthers vs Seahawks football game.  I will never patronized with Hickory Tavern again until they make this right with me and my friends. 5 thumbs down! \n",

            "I reluctantly use the race card, however, I truly believe that myself and my friends race, African American,  was determining and deciding factor as why the general manager elected to call the police.

            "The wings were good, the beer selection was respectable, and the menu featured a nice build your own salad option which was nice to see. The service was friendly and sassy for a bunch on a work trip. I noticed a nice outside seating area and a party room that was in use for a work function. Is it special? Not particularly, but it is a solid option if you are in the mood for that type of fare, good for family, friends, work, the game, etc. I would come here for the game before i would bww.\n",

            "The service at this location is horrible. The waitress would walk by our table 2 or 3 times before actually stopping to see what we needed. After we ordered the food took forever to come out and it was not busy. When they did bring the food mine was missing and came out several minutes later. The decor definitely needs a little update and the building was freezing. I had to get a blanket out of my car to bring in to warm up. Very disappointing visit for my family lunch.\n",
            "Decent bar food. Wines are pretty high in my opinion but Draft Beers aren't bad. Food is spot on BAR food. Don't go expecting anything fancy. Burger was tasty albeit SMALL (5oz?). Tuna app was decent but no mistaking it for sushi quality. \n",

            "Great food, fun atmosphere on a Saturday night. Hostess and wait staff a little off, but overall everything was great.\n",
            "This place is one of the few options you have in the neighborhood?, but luckily it would be great even on the busy restaurant street. The staff is always friendly, the food is very good and the bar has so many drink options?s you can get anything you need. They? have? ?a place for private events, tvs and game area and the sapece is open and airy. On top of all,? they have an outside seating area which is cute and so many specials during the week, you'll never get bored :)\n",
            "Stopped for a late lunch here. It wasn't very busy yet we still waited quite some time for anyone to get to us. We ordered a burger & a chicken sandwich. Both were okay but nothing special.  The service was incredibly slow & our drinks went unfilled until someone other than our waiter refilled them. Asked for ranch & honey mustard & didn't get that until we were both about done with our meals. Pretty pricey for what you get. Doubt we'll be back\n",
            "Food is typical bar food. However, I did have a salad which was pretty good. The service was better than most for a bar and grill. They have plenty of tvs for watching sports. I would say give it a try for the atmosphere and drinks, not necessarily the food.\n",
            "Just ok, very typical sports bar. The food is good and the service is decent. They have a large variety of beer and liquor which is always good. No much to say about this place. Its typical. I did love their tavern chips and cucumber wasabi.\n",
            "Decent place for apps and standard  American bar fare.  Not a huge fan of this type of food, but if that's what you like, they do a good job.\n",

            "And a biggie for us, they were open Christmas Eve.  This location is relatively new and has a large, airy atmosphere with high ceilings and tons of TVs.  I've been to the Pinehurst location before, and ordered the same meal at both locations, the delicious Carolina burger.  As anyone that knows me knows, the best condiment for a burger is more meat.  The Carolina burger offers that meaty condiment in the form of chili paired with mustard.  The burger is above average (mostly due to only having two options for temperature, medium well or well done - they may as well ask if I want my burger bone dry or burned), but the fries steal the show - in between steak and shoestring in size, they were cooked perfectly.  They also have 1554 (in addition to Fat Tire), which helps soothe my New Belgium beer cravings.  I can imagine this place being great to watch NFL games on Sundays.\n",

            "All in all, you can't really go wrong with Hickory Tavern - dependable food in a low key atmosphere with good beer.  Things could be much worse in life.  Now to get Red Oak onto the Hickory Tavern taps, and 1554 onto other restaurants taps.\n",
            "Placed an order through postmates and left a note letting them now I dont eat meat. Then called to let them know i dont eat meat and not to put meat in my salad and to instead. Add an extra roll. Instead of getting what i requested i get a salad with bacon and ham in it. Called them to have the salad refunded back on my card because i had to dispose of it and was told i would just get my whole meal replaced for free. So I call the next day to have the meal replaced so i could pick it up and a manager states \"we keep the names in a call log and details of the issue, your name isnt on there\" whos fault is that? YOURS. I had proof that i called, proof that i ordered, and proof that i even left a note in the postmates order. The idiot that answered the phone at the bar messed my order up in the first place and you promise me a meal to be replaced and now you tell me no? Offering to replace the salad was generous on the 2nd managers behalf that i spoke too, but lets get a little more organized.\n",
            "Our experience tonight was well above expectation! Our server, Michael, was outstanding and even went the extra mile to shake our hands at the end of the meal, perfect touch! Our orders were made correctly, the atmosphere was perfect. I will definitely make this one of my more visited destinations in the area!\n",

Processed and junk foods are the means of rapid and unhealthy weight gain and negatively impact the whole body throughout the life. It makes able a person to gain excessive weight which is called as obesity. Junk foods tastes good and looks good however do not fulfil the healthy calorie requirement of the body. Some of the foods like french fries, fried foods, pizza, burgers, candy, soft drinks, baked goods, ice cream, cookies, etc are the example of high-sugar and high-fat containing foods. It is found according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention that Kids and children eating junk food are more prone to the type-2 diabetes. In type-2 diabetes our body become unable to regulate blood sugar level. Risk of getting this disease is increasing as one become more obese or overweight. It increases the risk of kidney failure. Eating junk food daily lead us to the nutritional deficiencies in the body because it is lack of essential nutrients, vitamins, iron, minerals and dietary fibers.
