Q1. Folder Question 1 FNN contains code for Question 1 in the Assignment:
Only PyTorch-FNN.ipynb must be run to load and preprocess the data as well as train the FNN models and observe the output of the models and the generated text. The results including generated text, plots for model loss and model perplexity are present in Question 1 FNN/results.
